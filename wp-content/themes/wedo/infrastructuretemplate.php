                            <h3>Network</h3>
<p>A network infrastructure is an interconnected group of computer systems linked by the various parts of a telecommunications architecture. Specifically, this infrastructure refers to the organization of its various parts and their configuration — from individual networked computers to routers, cables, wireless access points, switches, backbones, network protocols, and network access methodologies. Infrastructures can be either open or closed, such as the open architecture of the Internet or the closed architecture of a private intranet. They can operate over wired or wireless network connections, or a combination of both. </p>
                            <h5>Overview</h5>
                            <p>Developed from the start as a network operating system, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server continues to improve its presence on networks and the Internet. Microsoft is following the worldwide trend of using the Internet for as much as possible.</p>
                            <p>Windows 2000 Server will help companies make better use of their Internet connections. By providing support for additional standardized features of TCP/IP, Microsoft has improved the performance of its premier network operating system both for communications with other Windows systems and with UNIX systems. Technologies such as virtual private networks (VPNs) will allow organizations to reduce costs without sacrificing security. The routing features built in to Windows 2000 servers allow those servers to act as routers, with graphical user interfaces far superior to those of hardware-based routers. The new Quality of Service (QoS) standards allow more consistent and reliable networking, especially when using real-time audio and video.</p>
